Hey, I'm Sam, a passionate technology enthusiast. I'm a self-taught hobbyist of statistics, networking, automation, and data processing. As a hobbyist I try to do most things the hard way. I might be learning to configure iptables and nftables to jump the wifi from an old Toshiba laptop, or I might be spending my birthday trying to reinvent an algorithm. I like doing things like normalizing to the polar coordinate system and avoiding the right answers.

## My Projects:
1. **MilkCow**: A new project. I would say this it is a SQLite wrapper for building middleware, local storage solutions, and multiprocessing scripts using SQLite database files.
2. 
3. **Note Unfancy**: A lightweight shell script for quick note-taking from the terminal. It's full-featured with everything you could need but requires dmenu for the open feature.

I'm currently very busy learning, and experimenting with new ideas, but I can spin a lot of plates, given the plate is interesting. So, hit me up if you need more manpower on a project. I'll help any way I can.
